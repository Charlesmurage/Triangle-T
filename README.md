## ________________________________ |________________________________ |_________________________________________
## All sides are equal.             | sideA === SideB === sideC       | Equilateral Triangle.
## Two sides are exactly equal.     | sideA === SideB!= sideC         | Isosceles Triangle.
## None of the sides is equal, but  | sideA != sideB != sideC         | Scalene Triangle.
